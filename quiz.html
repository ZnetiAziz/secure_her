    <h1>Cybersecurity Awareness Quiz</h1>

   <!-- Section 1: Basic Cybersecurity (Course + Quiz) -->
<div class="section" id="section-1">
    <div class="course-section">
        <h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction to Basic Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px;">
            <strong>In today's interconnected digital landscape, cybersecurity has become a fundamental concern for individuals, businesses, and governments alike.</strong> 
            It involves the practice of safeguarding systems, networks, and sensitive information from unauthorized access, data breaches, or malicious attacks. 
            With the rise of cybercrime, ensuring robust protection has never been more important.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px;">
            <strong>One of the most pervasive and dangerous cyber threats is phishing.</strong> 
            Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where cybercriminals impersonate trusted entities—such as banks, online services, or even colleagues—to deceive individuals into disclosing personal or financial information. 
            These attacks often come in the form of emails, text messages, or websites that appear legitimate, but upon closer inspection, they contain subtle clues, such as misspelled URLs or urgent requests for sensitive information.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px;">
            <strong>In addition to understanding threats like phishing, another fundamental measure in protecting one's digital presence is the use of strong passwords.</strong>
            A strong password is one that is difficult for hackers to crack using techniques such as brute force attacks. 
            Such passwords should be a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and they should not contain easily guessed information like birthdays or common words.
            To further enhance security, individuals should use unique passwords for each account and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px;">
            By adopting these basic cybersecurity practices—being cautious about phishing attempts and creating strong, unique passwords—individuals can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to cyberattacks. 
            As technology continues to evolve, staying informed and vigilant is key to safeguarding personal data and privacy.

 <!-- Section 2: Password Security -->
<div class="section" id="section-2">
    <div class="course-section">
        <h2>Password Security Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Password security is a critical component in protecting personal information from unauthorized access. A strong password should follow specific guidelines to maximize its strength and minimize the risk of being hacked. Here are some best practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Password Length:</strong> A strong password should be at least 12 characters long. The longer it is, the harder it is for cybercriminals to crack it using brute force attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Password Complexity:</strong> Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., `G5h!r7B2@X9m`). Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdates or common words.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> It's essential to regularly update your passwords, especially for critical accounts like email, banking, or social media. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Password Managers:</strong> Using a password manager, such as LastPass, 1Password, or Dashlane, is highly recommended. These tools generate and store unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts, so you don't have to remember them all.</li>
            <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Whenever possible, enable 2FA for your accounts. 2FA adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second form of authentication (e.g., a code sent to your phone or email) in addition to your password. This ensures that even if your password is compromised, your account remains secure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By following these best practices, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of your accounts being compromised and ensure the safety of your personal information.</p>

<!-- Section 5: Phishing and Email Analysis -->
<div class="section" id="section-5">
    <div class="course-section">
        <h2>Understanding Phishing and Email Analysis</h2>
        <p>Phishing is a malicious attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications. There are several types of phishing, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spam:</strong> Unsolicited messages, often sent in bulk, that can include misleading offers or advertisements, but may not directly seek sensitive information.</li>
            <li><strong>Scam:</strong> Messages that promise unrealistic rewards or financial gains, tricking users into providing personal information or making payments.</li>
            <li><strong>Fraud:</strong> Involves more sophisticated schemes that often leverage social engineering techniques to deceive individuals into revealing confidential information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Email analysis is crucial in identifying and mitigating phishing threats. By examining email headers, individuals can uncover the origin of the email, track its path, and validate its authenticity. Tools like <a href="https://www.virustotal.com">VirusTotal</a> and <a href="https://www.abuseipdb.com">AbuseIPDB</a> can analyze links and attachments for known malicious behavior. For a comprehensive email analysis, it’s essential to check the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SPF (Sender Policy Framework):</strong> A security protocol that allows domain owners to specify which IP addresses are permitted to send emails on behalf of their domain, helping to prevent spoofing.</li>
            <li><strong>DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):</strong> An email authentication method that uses cryptographic signatures to verify that the email content has not been altered in transit and that it originates from a legitimate source.</li>
            <li><strong>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance):</strong> A protocol that builds on SPF and DKIM by providing instructions to email receivers about how to handle emails that fail authentication checks. It enables domain owners to receive reports on email authentication and usage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When analyzing phishing attempts, it's vital to look closely at the email's subject line, sender's address, and any URLs contained within. Hovering over links (without clicking) can reveal their true destination, allowing users to assess whether the link is legitimate. By employing open-source tools and techniques to analyze emails, individuals can protect themselves from falling victim to phishing scams.</p>

        <div class="course-section">
            <h2>Digital Security Laws and Women's Rights</h2>
            <p>Understanding digital security laws is crucial for protecting individual rights in the online environment. Various laws exist to safeguard individuals from online harassment and abuse, recognizing that women, in particular, are often disproportionately targeted in digital spaces. The Digital Protection Act serves as a legal framework that outlines the rights of individuals, ensuring protection against cyberbullying and harassment. It mandates online platforms to establish clear policies for reporting abuse and outlines legal consequences for offenders. Women should be aware of their rights and the resources available to them, including hotlines and legal aid services that specialize in online harassment cases. Familiarity with these reporting procedures empowers women to take action and seek justice when faced with online threats. Furthermore, many regions have enacted the Cyberbullying Prevention Act, which aims to prevent online harassment and promote safe online behavior. This law encourages schools, communities, and online platforms to work collaboratively in educating individuals about the importance of respectful online interaction. If a woman encounters online harassment, the best course of action is to report the incident to law enforcement, as they can provide immediate support and guidance. Ignoring harassment or deleting accounts may lead to further victimization, and posting about it on social media can sometimes escalate the situation. Therefore, understanding the legal framework surrounding digital security not only helps in protecting one's rights but also fosters a safer online environment for everyone.</p>
